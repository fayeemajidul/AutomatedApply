--> It's very tedious to apply on (LinkedIn/Dice):
    --> Automation with both Hybrid Scope can help us accomplish these redundant tasks.


Step 1: [Data Driven Architecture] w/ Rest Assured API:

      a. [Excel File] --> Retrieve Data from an Excel File.
         1) Pro:
            - Accessible.
            - Easily editable.
            - Most convenient.
         2) Con:
            - Very time consuming
            - Most difficult approach.

      b. [SQL querying] -->
          1) Pro
            - Remote Database.
            - Equally as efficient as Excel retrieving.
            - Others might not know how to use it.
          2) Con:
            - Others might not know how to use it.
            - Server needs to be active.

      c. [JSON file]
          1) Pro
            - Easiest method to retrieve data, using Jackson Library.
            - Almost anyone can use this.
          2) Con
            - Static, and needs continuous uploading
            - Very inefficient and continuous updating.

      Best Method: Excel Data Driven Integration.

     Strategy:
     ---> Compose Data to Excel Sheet, retrieve Data from Excel Sheet, Parse Data and Post Data to API.
